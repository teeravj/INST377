                    <p>I plan to become a database administrator or work within an IT department. Having previously worked with an IT Department, I would like to continue my work into that field, and possibly move in database administration. I also have a lot of library experience and would highly consider a graduate degree in Library Science through the iSchool if possible.</p>
